# EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

## Introduction
Employee performance and compensation are critical aspects of organizational success. This exploratory data analysis (EDA) aims to uncover insights about employee performance, salary distribution, and other workforce characteristics. By analyzing numerical and categorical data, we can identify trends, correlations, and disparities to support data-driven decision-making. This project explores the balance between performance, experience, and compensation while highlighting areas for improvement in employee retention, diversity, and equity.

## Goals of the Project
The primary objectives of this project include:

1. **Understanding Salary and Performance Distributions:** Analyze the patterns in salary and performance scores to identify key trends and anomalies.
2. **Correlation Analysis:** Evaluate relationships between numerical variables such as age, performance, and salary to uncover underlying factors influencing these metrics.
3. **Demographic Insights:** Study the distribution of age groups, genders, and locations to assess workplace diversity and inclusivity.
4. **Departmental Comparisons:** Compare performance and payment disparities across departments to ensure equitable resource allocation and support.
5. **Time-Series Trends:** Examine hiring patterns and performance rates over time to identify seasonality and long-term trends.
6. **Recommendations for Improvement:** Provide actionable insights to address gaps in diversity, equity, retention, and employee development.
